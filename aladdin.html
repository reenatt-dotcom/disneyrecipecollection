      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <div>
        <span>1 cup basmati rice</span><br>
        <span>1 ¾ cups vegetable broth</span><br>
        <span>1 tablespoon olive oil</span><br>
        <span>1 small onion, finely chopped</span><br>
        <span>2 cloves garlic, minced</span><br>
        <span>1 teaspoon ground cumin</span><br>
        <span>1 teaspoon ground coriander</span><br>
        <span>½ teaspoon turmeric</span><br>
        <span>½ teaspoon paprika</span><br>
        <span>½ teaspoon cinnamon</span><br>
        <span>Salt and pepper to taste</span><br>
        <span>Fresh cilantro or parsley, chopped (for garnish)</span>
      </div>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <div>
        <span>Wash the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</span><br>
        <span>In a large saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and lightly browned.</span><br>
        <span>Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, paprika, cinnamon, salt, and pepper to the saucepan. Stir well to combine and cook for an additional minute to release the flavors.</span><br>
        <span>Add the basmati rice to the saucepan and stir to coat the grains with the spice mixture.</span><br>
        <span>Pour in the vegetable broth and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer for about 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is tender and the liquid is absorbed.</span><br>
        <span>Remove from heat and let the rice sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</span><br>
        <span>Garnish with fresh cilantro or parsley and serve hot.</span><br>
