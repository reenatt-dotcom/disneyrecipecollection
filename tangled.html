      <h2>Braided Bread</h2>
      <div class="recipe">
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <div>
          <span>2 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</span><br>
          <span>1 tablespoon sugar</span><br>
          <span>1 teaspoon salt</span><br>
          <span>2 ¼ teaspoons instant yeast</span><br>
          <span>1 cup warm water</span><br>
          <span>2 tablespoons olive oil</span>
        </div>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <div>
          <span>Inspired by Rapunzel's long, braided hair, this bread is a delicious treat fit for a princess.</span><br>
          <span>Combine the flour, sugar, salt, and instant yeast in a large mixing bowl.</span><br>
          <span>Add warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough comes together.</span><br>
          <span>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic.</span><br>
          <span>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</span><br>
          <span>Punch down the dough and divide it into 3 equal portions.</span><br>
          <span>Roll each portion into a long rope-like shape, resembling Rapunzel's long hair.</span><br>
          <span>Place the ropes side by side and pinch one end together.</span><br>
          <span>Braid the ropes together, imagining Rapunzel's beautiful hair, and pinch the other end to seal.</span><br>
          <span>Transfer the braided bread to a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</span><br>
          <span>Cover the bread with a damp cloth and let it rise for another 30 minutes.</span><br>
          <span>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</span><br>
          <span>Bake the bread for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown.</span><br>
          <span>Remove from the oven and let it cool before serving.</span>
